# Windows7-Taskbar-Monitor

At-a-glance monitoring of essential system performance.

## Description

The idea is very simple. I like iStat Pro for the mac OS (<http://www.islayer.com/apps/istatpro/>) and I wanted similar system performance at-a-glance on windows too.

Seeing the new features in the Windows 7 taskbar I considered it would now be possible to present some very basic visual information in the taskbar.
